# Rethinking Contemporary Deep Learning Techniques for Error Correction in Biometric Data (source codes: click the link in releases)

ABSTRACT:
In the realm of cryptography, the implementation of error correction in biometric data offers benefits,
including secure data storage and key derivation. Deep learning-based decoders have emerged as a
catalyst for improved error correction when decoding noisy biometric data. Although these decoders
exhibit competence in approximating precise solutions, we expose the potential inadequacy of their
security assurances through a minimum entropy analysis. This limitation curtails their applicability
in secure biometric contexts, as the inherent complexities of their non-linear neural network architectures
pose challenges in comprehending the solution distribution. To address this limitation, we
introduce U-Sketch, a universal approach for error correction in biometrics, which converts arbitrary
input random biometric source distributions into independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data
while maintaining the pairwise distance of the data post-transformation. This method ensures interpretability
within the decoder, facilitating transparent entropy analysis and a substantiated security
claim. Moreover, U-Sketch employs Maximum Likelihood Decoding (MLD), which provides optimal
error tolerance and security guarantee.
